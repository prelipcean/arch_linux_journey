The difference between 1 GB and 1 Gb is a fundamental distinction between units of digital storage and data transfer:

- **GB (Gigabyte):**
    - This refers to a unit of digital storage.
    - A Gigabyte measures the amount of data that can be stored, like on a hard drive, USB drive, or in RAM.
    - It's important to understand that 1 Byte is equal to 8 bits. Therefore 1 Gigabyte is equal to 8 Gigabits.
- **Gb (Gigabit):**
    - This refers to a unit of data transfer rate.
    - A Gigabit measures how much data can be transferred over a network in a given amount of time, often expressed as Gigabits per second (Gbps).
    - So when you are talking about internet speeds, it is typically measured in Gigabits.

In essence:

- **Bytes (GB)** measure storage capacity.
- **Bits (Gb)** measure transfer speed.

Therefore, 1 GB is significantly larger than 1 Gb, as 1 GB equals 8 Gb.
